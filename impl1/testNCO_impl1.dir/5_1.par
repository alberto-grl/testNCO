Device utilization summary:

   PIO (prelim)   22+4(JTAG)/336     8% used
                  22+4(JTAG)/115     23% bonded

   SLICE             29/3432         <1% used

   EBR                2/26            7% used
   PLL                2/2           100% used


INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation: The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. See the device specific data sheet for additional details.
INFO: Design contains pre-loadable EBR during configuration that has a requirement: Since the GSR is disabled for the EBR, make sure write enable and chip enable are inactive during wake-up, so that the pre-loaded initialization values will not be corrupted during wake-up state.
Number of Signals: 103
Number of Connections: 235

Pin Constraint Summary:
   13 out of 22 pins locked (59% locked).

WARNING - par: RPLL must be put in reset state during background Flash programming. System design must take this into consideration when PLL is used during background Flash programming. Please see TN1204 MachXO2 Programming and Configuration Usage Guide for detailed information.
The following 3 signals are selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    osc_clk (driver: PLL1/PLLInst_0, clk load #: 4)
    TX_c (driver: PLL2/PLLInst_0, clk load #: 0)
    clk_adc_c (driver: SLICE_25, clk load #: 16)


No signal is selected as secondary clock.

No signal is selected as Global Set/Reset.

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design.
