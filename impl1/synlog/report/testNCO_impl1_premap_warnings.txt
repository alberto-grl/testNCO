@W: MT529 :"c:\users\alberto\lattice\testnco\impl1\source\nco.v":33:0:33:5|Found inferred clock PLL|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 64 sequential elements including ncoGen.phase_accum[63:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
